# Work

I contract regularly and I am always open to talk about work!

In the past, I have worked on

- building design systems
- architecting data heavy front ends
- design engineering

Apart from this, I would _like_ to work on

- engineering management
- building graph-based UIs
- data visualisation
- building apps on canvas
- building a WebRTC product
- your problem here?

I am based out of Bangalore, India. I am flexible with my schedule and can be available on US/EU timelines as needed.

Here is an (inexhaustive) list of work I have done over the last few years.

## Math and Pencil

[Math and Pencil](https://www.mathandpencil.com/) builds technology to streamline operations in the medical and property insurance space. I was part of a team that built a medical compliance product that would provide middle managers at BigCorp with a single admin interface that simplifies case intake, FMLA verification, and other workflow stages.

- I designed a system that allowed anyone in the business unit with the necessary information to instantiate a form by feeding it a JSON schema. This significantly freed up engineering load and allowed faster prototyping from non-core engineers.
- I architected the client interface to handle local and offline data reliably to prevent data loss.
- I built out all the form and complex ui components necessary.
- I integrated OAuth with the app

## Appsmith

[Appsmith](https://www.appsmith.com/) is an open-source low-code platform for tech power-users to quickly build internal tools. In order to unify several competing UX patterns around the app, increase polish, and pay down tech debt, a design system was necessary.

- Built the [appsmith design system](https://github.com/appsmithorg/design-system/) to be complete, [accessible, well-tested, and correctly themed](https://design-system.appsmith.com/?path=/docs/ads-components-avatar--docs).
- Refactored ~50k loc to use this system across all parts of the codebase, and upon release received no p0 or p1 bugs. This project was derisked by carrying out a similar effort in much smaller scope earlier in the process, implementing a type system across the app, and significantly increasing the org-wide standard for code that could be committed.
- Set up processes to streamline design-dev handoff, and org-ds team hand-off.
- Wrote documentation and tests for the design-system

## Sprinto

Sprinto

- Built a proof-of-concept around creating a design system and evaluated working with Ant Design for it

## Unbox Arena

- Built a website to demo various games that were created inhouse

## CIS

- digitalid.design

## Sultana Zana

- Built an art project that allowed users to record audio on a map, and access various other audio recordings on a map that was showcased at an art installation in Milan

## Obvious - unnamed seriesA funded client

-

## Obvious - wikipedia project

- scrapped several existing sites from wikipedia
- App allowed for multiple language support
- Built a whole new interface for wikipedia, including an Instagram stories experience, and a quizzing experience

## Org name

What it is, time period and method of engagement with them, results I got for them after the challenges I faced.
