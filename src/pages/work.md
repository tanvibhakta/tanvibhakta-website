# Work

[this page is a work-in-progress. It is available in the interest of building fast, in public, and all that other good stuff]

I contract regularly and I am always open to talk about work! My niche over the years has been building **web-based design systems** and setting up **front-end engineering processes**. I would love to do work that is outside this niche - backends, graph-based UIs, data viz, canvas, WebRTC. I would also **really like to do Engineering Management**.

I am based out of Bangalore, India. I am flexible with my schedule and can be available on US/EU timelines as needed.
