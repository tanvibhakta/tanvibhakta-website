# Now

I’m 28 years old. I live with my 3 cats and a large number of good friends within a 30 minute auto ride distance.

I’m [continuing to contract out](https://tanvibhakta.in/work/) to engineering teams that are looking for talent for well-scoped projects - though these days I’m moving out of my design system niche into broader engineering roles. I’d like to lead a project and/or a team.
I am working on a project until the end of November but am likely to have availability after that and would like to talk to you!

I’ve been thinking a lot about cognitive independence. To that end, I’ve spent some time over the last few months getting off of traditional social media, setting up this ~~blog~~ home to my web presence, and am attempting to syndicate back to where people are from here.

I’ve also (finally) developed a regular writing habit, courtesy a closed writer’s club I helped create in February 2024 and meet up with every weekend. I also run [IndieWebClub](https://underline.center/c/indiewebclub/10) with [Ankur](https://ankursethi.com/) at [underline.center](https://underline.center) - we meet twice a month. Previously I have helped shape various dev communities in Bangalore (Pyladies, GirlsWhoJS, Free Software Movement Karnataka) and I continue to enjoy talking to people and making communities happen.

Off screen, I have been doing calisthenics, running every Sunday, speed puzzling jigsaws, and consuming large amounts of serious SFF and smutty fan fiction.

If you’re in Bangalore or if you just want to chat, please shoot me an email! I love talking to new people.
