# Care for Tanvi toolkit

Generally speaking, if I am ill and physically in your space,

1. Take charge
2. Don’t be incompetent
3. Put away things

## Food

Have I eaten in the last 4 hours? If I don’t have an appetite,

It’s because I can’t stomach the idea of food. The trick is to get me excited about some food.

- go through various cuisines
- go through various dishes from those cuisines that can be delivered to where I am in less than 30 minutes
- offer to order the food I pick for me (please for the love of god put the thing on splitwise)

Sometimes I don’t like the idea of anything from outside, or want to avoid the expense.

- present various taste options to me. For example
  - spicy and fatty, like chilli oil?
  - how about spicy and nutty and a little sour, like sumac?
  - earthy and sour and nutty, like zaatar?
- If I’m at home, getting me to go up to my pantry and suggesting easy things I can make with the things that catch my eye is a great idea.

I might not want a big meal. Some snack options

- popcorn (with cheese powder)
- hot chips (chilli powder extra)
- boiled eggs (with chilli oil, mustard, or chat masala)
- Doritoes, Cheetos type cheesy chip things

It might also be worthwhile to encourage me to leave my location, and walk around to find something to eat. This might be especially prudent if I haven’t left the house so far, if I have spent a lot of time on the screen that day, or if I am being anxious about a specific thing.

- chaat (masala puri!)
- pav bhaji type things
- tea/coffee and nippat type items
- idli/vada/golibaji

June 2025 edit: I am off of gluten and dairy for the next two months to observe the effect it has on my inflammation. All food and ordering options will need to be screened for this and I might run out of options and get frustrated faster. All food options in the above categories are indicative. If you could actively suggest items that fit the scenario that are also gluten/dairy free (or can be modified to be so) that would be incredible.

## General pain days

If the pain is actively concentrated in/around the neck and shoulder,

- cold compress with cotton wrapped around it, pressed to area of pain
- hot water pack pressed to place
- dynamic stretches
  - If I have time and haven’t showered yet, my full calisthenics warm up routine - just to get the blood flowing
  - neck rotations, direction stretches
  - loose jumps, arm swings, shoulder cars
  - Yuri’s shoulder stretches

For general pain,
