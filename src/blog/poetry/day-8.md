# Day 8

> Published on Apr 8, 2025

My parents  
 from Chikmagalur  
My context  
 the old forgotten gulf  
My constant  
 english entertainment  
A true false third culture kid

Let me be one of your continentals, Shahid  
Let me study for a degree that makes me no money

In the Gulf I was taught to be patriotic  
Now mom says Iâ€™m not enough nationalistic

Accounts of large crowds, told matter-of-factly  
What taint is attached to the journalistic?

Thirty years spent meekly, then explosion of hatred  
on return, no empathy. Why am I not optimistic?

No one walks anymore, only iron bubbles on bad roads  
eyes closed to the scores gathering at Majestic

I am drowning, holding on to the feminine  
While here insists on being chauvinistic.
