# Day 6: Watermelon

> Published on Apr 6, 2025

Splash  
A pink cube  
plinks  
onto her thin skin  
slides  
down her chin  
Goosebumps  
mocking me

The taste of freedom  
fresh air  
91% water  
a hint of green  
“over fifty thousand seeds  
snuffed out”  
she tells me

Olive skin  
breaks  
under mine
