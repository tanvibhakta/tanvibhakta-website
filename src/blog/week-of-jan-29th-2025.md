# Week of Jan 29th, 2025

> Published on Jan 29, 2025

I’m late on this weeknote again. The weekend was excellent - I attended Bengawalk’s Cooke Town walkability assessment and also Visaka George’s workshop on creating ethical content. But the week itself has been pretty crap. I’ve had one of those terrible headaches for two days straight. I worked out but my brain hasn’t caught up. I’m ignoring friends who live far away, it feels like more effort than I have in me to keep up long distance relationships. I have been cheating on my social-media free diet by spending entirely too much time on reddit. Need to train my brain to be okay with spending effort and not being immediately rewarded.

I have been dreading writing this because it feels like I did too little this week, but that is in fact the point of these week notes - to be reflective so that next week is better. I did do a lot this week, but what’s making me feel otherwise is the fact that I didn’t follow through on research and writing about things I wanted. Sorry for the diary entry folks, sometimes it just do be like that.

## Media diet

I watched Nosferatu. Very interesting.
I played Puyo Puyo Tetris, and realised I have never actually played Tetris before.
I continue to be obsessed with Sudoku, but I think I broke it, finally. I either need to learn a new strategy or give it a little bit of a rest.
I’ve been continuing listening to Raven Boys, and it feels like a fever dream.

No links for you, I’m allowed to practice bad blag etiquette. See you next week!
