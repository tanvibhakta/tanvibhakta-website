<!-- I work on a few projects from time to time. This site is perhaps my biggest and most time consuming. I also work on a few scripts now and then when I'm in the right mood.

I recently wrote a simple md5 hasher and hashcracker in Python. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/paradoxdjell/hashcracker" target="_blank">Github</a>.

I also wrote a program which will go through the suspects list on <a href="https://www.sabrefilms.co.uk/revolutionelite/" target="_blank">Revolution Elite</a> missions to find the culprit based on the parameters given. I hope I get around to uploading it soon.

I also try my hand at various missions on <a href="http://enigmagroup.org" target="_blank">Enigma Group</a>. It's an amazing site to learn the basics of programming and general intrusion tactics.

Keep an eye on my <a href="https://github.com/paradoxdjell" target="_blank">Github profile</a> where I'll upload more soon. -->
