The pre-event dinner was happening in one of the buildings on the Google Cloud Campus, Mountain View. This was the first run-up event to IO that the 5 of us were attending, and boy were we nervous. Initially, we were unsure as to what the event would look like - I mean, it's a "networking event", what are you even supposed to do? Then, Deepak (our brilliant program manager) was kind enough to introduce us to some key people from India, and that was all we needed.

1. **Put yourself in a place with a lot of people.** If it's a dinner event, seat yourself at a table with people you mostly don't know. Practice open body language, and make sure you have it when you go to get a drink at the bar. Ask to join in to games, if those have been set up. Photobomb some pictures if the group is already pulling a few silly poses. Compliment people, if they have cool hair/bags/clothes/piercings. There was a lady with beautiful multi-colored hair in cornrows, and I just plopped down next to her and had to tell her how amazing she looked. It turned out that she's a  And that's it, you now have an opening to strike up a conversation. What next?
2. **Ask them what they do and in what capacity they are at the event.** Then ask them questions about the position themselves - how did they get there? What tech do they work with? What problems are they passionate about solving? The GDG dinner had representation from all over the *world* and with all sorts of backgrounds, and yet I found that most people were united by the larger vision they had for their world, and were passionate about solving similar types of problems - to do with skilling developers, and helping people from their local community have access to opportunities equal to the rest of the world out there.
3. Once they start answering these questions, you have a lot of material about things they do - and odds are you will relate to at least one thing they said. **Talk about how your goals can be aligned**, and how they can help you understand/do X thing/vice-versa. Boom! You now have a new connection to add to your network.
4. **Make sure you follow up on your connection.** I like to add people on LinkedIn right away and message them on there on a weekend once the event is over, along with any action items I committed to during the chat. This could be sending them links to a project I know of similar to something they're working on, or telling them that I talked to Y about Z thing and I'm now this much closer to doing M.
5. Bonus: You will always get more out of any event if you go in knowing what questions you want answered. These don't need to be specific, and you don't need to find a way to insert the question itself into every conversation, but having some general ideas about a domain you want more information on can be helpful to get the most out of every conversation.
