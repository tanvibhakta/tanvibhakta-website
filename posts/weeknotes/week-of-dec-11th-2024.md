## Work

The weight of learning is upon me.
I‚Äôve been doing the [astro](https://astro.build/) tutorial quite religiously, and in the process I‚Äôve learnt that I have many opinions on frameworks and javascript. It‚Äôs a comforting feeling, and validating my skill as an engineer. Maybe I‚Äôll write them up one day.

Akila is learning how to make websites too, and I am pumped! I love teaching programming concepts, it makes things crystal clear in my head. Also, gmeet calls debugging terminal things at 0030 are a great way to feel alive. Been thinking that maybe I have had _too much_ work life balance lately.

## Life

Spent a weekend with the nesting partner after a long time. Met his friends from out of town, and it filled me with so much love. We ate steak at [Millers46](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qgchx123kHj1L6QAA), drank mulled wine, and reminded ourselves why we actually like each other.

A friend is going through a hard time with a relationship and I've spent lots of time to support them. [Ankur](https://ankursethi.in/) and I dropped them to the airport! We saw the metro tracks being laid next to the highway and I can‚Äôt wait to be able to take (more reliable) public transport to the airport in my city.

After [RC Coworking](https://captnemo.in/cowork/) on Tuesday I went to [Puzzled Pint](https://blr.puzzledpint.com/). My first PP was in 2018 when I had just started interning at [Obvious](https://obvious.in/) (Co-incidentally, my first PP was with [Chandra](https://nchandrasekharr.github.io/), whom I ran into again yesterday!). I stopped going two years ago because I felt like I wasn‚Äôt having fun, and I just had too much else going on. But yesterday was excellent! I think it really helped that the friends I was with were highly focused and efficient üòÅ

## Health

I had a terrible migraine last Wednesday that carried over to Thursday.
On Monday I went to an ENT who told me the itch in my throat doesn‚Äôt have a presentation in my throat and might be coming from somewhere else.
I still haven‚Äôt gone to the dermatologist.

This last week has been a flare week for me, which meant I was back to losing mornings, but today morning I came back strong! Let‚Äôs hope this is prescient of the flare going away for now until next time.

I have gone to the gym at least once a week for 6 weeks in a row now! ü•≥

## Thoughts

Language is so inefficient for communication. Reading RSS feeds is so much nicer for the brain than reading social media posts (even if they‚Äôre heavily curated). I have an itch to build a more disparate, professional community again. Breathing is underrated.

## Media diet

Watching: Blue Eye Samurai
Reading: I updated all my reads for this year (and left review dumps on some of them!) over at [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/tanvibhakta).
