## Work

I deployed a service I wrote, architected a bigger service (but didn’t get to implement it yet) and architected another experiment that will be my first one working with a proper team in a year or two. We also finally have an issue tracker and a general everyday tracker! I get so much energy from being a part of things just starting out, and the momentum on this feels bigger than the other things I’ve been a part of.

I’m focusing on familiarising myself with the breadth of deep tech over the next few months. I don’t have the time or energy to spend on honing my product building intuition (yet) but I’m part of product discussions every day and I’m learning so much about it just by listening and osmosis.

We already have a 7 person team! The whole team was in Bangalore for the week, and that in-person momentum was also very energising. By Friday everyone had left and the office felt a little dull. I am not very happy with my commute but I am not going to stop going to office for as long as people are around.

## Health

I fixed my ergonomics set up, which meant I moved a lot more this week in the day to day. My wrists are very happy. I need to buy a high chair, with cushioning, a feet rest, swivel, and possibly a back rest - am open to recommendations.

My flare from last week went away by Monday but was back on Wednesday, and I’ve been a little more fatigued this week than the last. Saturday was especially bad, but that is because I stayed up late and did a small house party at a friend’s on a whim. I was working in their living room! But then Ghalib was playing and one thing let to another... This weekend wasn’t super restful either, but we have a Thursday holiday this week and I’m wfh WedThuFri so let’s hope it doesn’t get worse.

I spoke to the vet at Casper yesterday. After looking at Litchee, they said the gingivitis is definitely bad but we can give dental scaling another go before the teeth removal - yay! We also need to up his teeth brushing regimen. The scaling is scheduled for Wednesday.

## Life

Self-care consists of two things for me - movement and people. I’ve fixed the former for my self at work, so the latter had to happen post work. The batteries need social hangs to be recharged, even if it’s an alone-together kind of presence. That has meant I’ve been spending a lot of time with friends at the cost of sleep. I have spent not more than an hour each day at home alone - and it shows! I am really looking forward to getting that time with house and self during WedThuFri - and maybe even SatSun given that this is festival week, I’m unlikely to do social calls.
