## Work

I have found something exciting and challenging to do. A friend is building a product that helps designers who code iterate UIs very quickly (using AI to build a codebase according to the prompt and preview the design). The product is essentially a chat stream and a canvas which lets you do all the things Figma does, but instead of manipulating rectangles you are manipulating windows that look into whole ass projects that have their own file structure. Iâ€™m optimising some of UX flows for this product. It is

- complex but doable
- comes with the ease of working with this friend
- keeps my brain occupied even when itâ€™s resting

I cannot explain how nice the last thing has been. I seem to have forgotten how much I enjoy working on tough problems.

Iâ€™ve also been doing [GloPoWriMo](https://www.napowrimo.net/) this month! I havenâ€™t posted any here yet, because I wanted to apologise to my regular week note readers before I do - there doesnâ€™t seem to be a way in Mataroa to create multiple (rss) feeds and I still havenâ€™t gotten around to putting my blog up (weekend?) so all of you will unfortunately be subjected to one poem a day for this month. My apologies ðŸ˜¬

## Life

Iâ€™ve had a very busy week! Iâ€™ve been working at least 6 hours a day every day, and I also hung out with like 5 different friends. Sunday was Ugadi, and I went to the parentâ€™s house for it. I was dreading having to help mom cut veggies and make lunch while the boys sat in the hall doing their thing (like Iâ€™ve done every time Iâ€™ve gone to theirs since I moved into this place two years ago) but I was pleasantly surprised! Dad had already done a bunch of stuff, so it was very chill. I drove some more, this time on highways to Yelahanka, inside it, and back. I am getting really good at this, but for tight fits (esp when Iâ€™m going at 40) I still need someone to point things out to me. I have also discovered Iâ€™m a chatty driver - no, I donâ€™t want to have conversations when Iâ€™m driving, I just want to talk at/to someone about the quality of the driving and the flowers on the tree coming up and the crowded Darshini we just passed by that I want to go to. Itâ€™s great! I canâ€™t wait to inflict this on everybody else. Also, this is going to be a bit of a cliche but while I understand and appreciate the ease of a manual car, it rankles just a bit when I need to be on 4th gear and the car takes 3 seconds when I know I could have done it faster.

Who am I? I have car opinions!

I am better at driving and better at Carrom than I was a week ago. I did [Ravensburgerâ€™s Floral Reflections](https://www.ravensburger.org/ca-en/products/jigsaw-puzzles/adult-puzzles/floral-reflections-12000213/index.html) at [Playful Pursuits](https://www.instagram.com/playful.pursuits/) on Monday and hurt my shoulder, but learnt more about shape sorting and speed puzzling that I am somehow still not able to apply to [Tuttleâ€™s Cherry Blossom season in Old Tokyo](https://www.tuttlepublishing.com/japan/cherry-blossom-season-in-japan-jigsaw-puzzle-1-000-pieces). I also did the [ensky artcrystal waterpokemon ](https://www.plazajapan.com/4970381197780/) with the partner for a date night that was incredibly fulfilling. I went to two parties - held court with [bananagrams](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/27225/bananagrams) at one, and went to the quiet room and napped in the other. This has been a gorgeous week and I hope to have more of these <3

## Health

No headaches! Again, who AM I?! I havenâ€™t been very regular with my nose sprays and Iâ€™ve been needing melatonin to go to sleep because Iâ€™m too wired. Iâ€™ve been getting up groggy even on non-melatonin days, must be the fibro protesting at all the things Iâ€™m putting my body through. I did one (1) 20 minute workout at home that Iâ€™ve been wanting to repeat but havenâ€™t found the time.

I broke my no social media rule this week. Two different times, totalling about 6 hours of scrolling which is relatively low for the average internet user, but it didnâ€™t make me feel good after it. I need to scratch the do-something-small itch better.

## Learning

I did maybe one Mandarin lesson this week :( Since Iâ€™ve been working a lot more AND writing a poem a day, Iâ€™ve looked at the task on my todo list and just pushed it, which is sad, so now Iâ€™m going to do Mandarin first thing in the morning.

In general, my todo list hasnâ€™t been as helpful this week, because there are only so many things Iâ€™ve had time to do. Still havenâ€™t figured out prioritisation.

## Media

### Watching

Iâ€™ve been really enjoying Taskmaster - specifically [season 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNTxnYm81n8&list=PLRWvNQVqAeWI4Fpgkl3gMg2Rnx0dZ_s0r). [Sarah Kendall](https://taskmaster.fandom.com/wiki/Sarah_Kendall) has been so entertaining to watch and [Mike Wozniak](https://taskmaster.fandom.com/wiki/Mike_Wozniak) of course is a treasure.

White Lotus continues to White Lotus.

### Reading

Iâ€™m almost done with Project Hail Mary! I think the book especially shone in audiobook format and I appreciate it. Detailed review will come up on goodreads in a few days.

### Around the web

1. This deep dive into [Lake Tahoeâ€™s bear problem](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/12/02/lake-tahoes-bear-boom) was a really fun listen because I learnt a lot of things that had nothing to do with my reality, which is the most fun kind of learning. Paywall but free to listen.
2. I havenâ€™t finished reading this article yet because it hit a little too close to home but I know this one is a keeper: [Life Design](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/life-design?r=3d0k2&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true) by Ava Bookbear
3. [Rohini](https://www.instagram.com/roh_malur/) from [QRB](https://www.instagram.com/queerreadsbangalore/) shared [this excellent sci-fi short story](https://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/blit.htm) set in a future UK which references Indian immigrants.
