I’m not drowning any more, but this week has continued to be intense.

Wednesdays are supposed to be weeknote day, but on weeks where I can’t do that, the last 4 days stay in my head and I lose 5 days to talk about.

## Work

Starting Tuesday, it’s been non-stop! A throw-away conversation at [RC Coworking](https://captnemo.in/cowork/) has got me interested in WebRTC, and I’ve spent lots of my time exploring what it would take to do multi-channel video on the web.

I’ve also started the [Writing for Nerds](https://www.evalapply.org/index.html#writing-for-nerds) course, and:

1. I’ve written every day, and had an accountability call every week (yay!)
2. I’ve been late to most of those calls (boo!)
3. I’ve been inspired to spend more time working on tanvibhakta.in (yay!)

I don’t know how useful this is to anyone, but I’m increasingly convinced I want to dump my WIP notes on my website as well. I don’t interlink between my own writing nearly as much as I should, and this dump coupled with links for every paragraph should make things easier.

On Saturday, we did the second installment of [IndieWebClub](https://underline.center/t/indiewebclub-with-ankur-and-tanvi/343), and 14 people wrote, 10 of whom published a blogpost! I am so proud of all of us - it’s not easy, but ✨ _the power of community_ ✨ will lift us all together.

On Sunday, I wrote another horror short story. It’s interesting to me how

- I don’t read or watch horror at all, and yet it comes so easy to me to create it (2 out of 4 short stories I’ve written in the last year are horror)
- All of the horror I write also has a sexual element to it. To be vulnerable is to be open to violation.

## Life

I got my house pest-controlled. There were wood bores nesting somewhere and it was getting too annoying. But this involved me moving all the cats to the house of a very generous friend, doing 32786 loads of laundry, getting a new (to me) couch! And moving the cats back again. Of course Jalebi attempted a very daring break during his time at my friend’s house. Nobody believes that he is an escape artist until they experience his artistry for themselves. I am so glad for the presence of mind of these friends to save him from himself. And very sorry for the scratches they acquired in the process. I need to make it up to them.

I haven’t wanted to cook for a long time. Not even small things, like my garlic mayo, or miso soup, or even jackfruit jam. I don’t know why - maybe I am getting my creative outlet in other places and so don’t feel the need?

## Health

I had a headache this week. It was probably the stress of moving everything and back. I have missed access to a car many times in the last few days. The public transport girlie in me is not ready to accept this. Maybe she gave me the headache.

I’m solidly in the midpoint of my pushup journey. It is very annoying - I don’t want to do it anymore! But I will give it three more weeks before I start working on a pull up out of spite. I did do a whole set of monkey bars! I did several walk on hands with my legs on the wall and I got so close! I’m working on getting into Chakrasan from a standing position!

## Media

Very little media. Watched a random episode of Hacks (nice show!), listened to a lot more Indian hiphop. New Miley Cyrus and Tash Sultana albums out this week. Reviews out next. See ya!
