This note is significantly shorter than the others owing to a great deal of excitement on other things to do.

## Major updates

1. Test came back positive, yes I am allergic to cats, and further, I have had a completely blocked nose for at least two years now (how did I not know this?!!?). I've been given some sprays and already, 4 days in, I feel better in ways I did not know how.
2. Been thinking about the need for urgency
3. Mosque Road walk was excellent as usual, though unfortunately not as prolific as it used to be, for obvious state of the country reasons.
4. Finally finished the parahumans series, and now I can move on with my life. I'm now reading Project Hail Mary, I have thoughts that are for next week.
5. Been thinking about how to change how I engage with hyperfixations, and what the opposite of content consumption is. Maybe I'll write a longer post, but it might be too vulnerable for the internets.
6. I have purchased a very gorgeous, very expensive leather backpack for my EDC. The nesting partner has given me half of it, and convinced me to drop the $$ - I tend to be reticent about that kind of thing. It will arrive with all the art crystal puzzles and the pet dander removal solution on Saturday. Life is looking like it's on the upturn.

See you next week!
