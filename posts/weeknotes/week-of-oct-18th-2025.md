## Work

I spent lots of time rebasing things and I was very annoyed by it, so I wrote a [mild flame about it](http://localhost:4321/blog/rebase-doesnt-work-for-modern-development-teams).

## Health

Had a flare all week, and since this week was in-office with the team I made the excellent decision to get a driver for the mornings. My arm was thankful.

## Life

I had a [tantrum on Tuesday](http://localhost:4321/blog/conflict-is-a-valuable-relationship-metric), dinner with [Chandra](https://nchandrasekharr.github.io/portfolio/), a call with a Goa-based cat behaviorist who seemed very helpful (for litchee x jamun fights), and indie web club’s tech session on Saturday where as per usual I didn’t get as much done as I would like.
