No real weeknote this time. Litchee continues to recover well (so many of you asked! Thank you ❤️). He's still on the liquid diet but has stolen some dry food when I wasn't paying attention, and the others are scheming to get at his wet food, so all's well in the world, really. I was WFH most of last week so it was chill, but this next week the team's in office so it's going to be tough - esp with deepavali and crackers coming up. If you're reading this, you probably don't need the reminder, but here; please don't burst crackers that make loud sounds. They're horrible for anyone easily startled, your own hearing, and all animals everywhere.

There's supposed to be a very nice meteor shower next weekend but I can't drive out 8 hours to a dark spot, so. :(

I am tired. I'm not doing much except care for the babies, work, and play Hades. Hades 2 is brilliant. It's hard to follow up a perfect game, but Supergiant did it! The sequel feels like a sequel in that it pays homages to the orginal storyline and extends ot so beautifully, but it's much bigger - in terms of story, scope, and ambition. I'm finding myself relating to the character of Melinoë much easier than I did Zagreus. Perhaps it helps that she's a first-bencher kind of character. Maybe it's just that she's a woman.

I am tired because it's strange to be an employee. When you're contracting, deadlines are important. But you're also mostly working by yourself and you're in control of how work gets done. With teams, a lot of the time your work is dependent on other people's. And timelines get pushed but people don't seem to talk about it. I think I have work to do to get comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty. This is actually a call i need to make - as a consultant, my ability to clarify ambiguity and hedge uncertainty is an asset. As an employee, it feels... annoying. How do I marry the two?

I'm also tired because it's back. The flare is back. What else to say?

I have placed an order for running shoes. Very very excited. Also my most expensive shoe purchase to date. In keeping with my small movements philosophy for this year, I'm going to attempt to do about a 1 to 2km run every other day. Here's my to-do list from when I was running last:

1. Figure out my bpm (mostly so I can find music to go along with my run)
2. Actively breathe in rhythm with the steps and the beats
3. And do this so naturally that it feels like this is easy.

I wrote most of this weeknote at a concert - I went to Glass Beams all by myself. I have attended so many gigs in the last three or four years, but this is the first time I went by myself. It was an incredible experience. I got there reasonably early and was sorry of doing my own thing. I ended up sitting next to some folks who looked loud and boisterous and in a tight group - i realised later that I probably gravitated there because they looked different from all the heterosexual couples I was seeing around me. But also because they looked chill... And then while eavesdropping i discovered they were gay. Of course I would gravitate towards the gayze. We wouldn't have spoken to each other except some dude came and caused a fight - and he threw a slur at one of the people!! The way we instantly became best friends to ward off this asshole, I'm telling you us minorities have got each other's backs every where. Of course I had matched with at least one of them on Bumble haha. The queer community everywhere is incestuous, and Bangalore/Goa cross-pollination is strong. I'm wondering if Bombay/Goa is similar?

I really enjoyed going by myself and making friends there. Surprisingly, I would also have been okay if I didn't make friends! This is brand new. My new friends also added me to a few gig and ticket resale groups for Bangalore, so I suppose I will do this some more. I was considering doing Lollapalooza alone (managing a large group is hard, and without some regulars showing up this time will be harder), but I don't know if I'm brave enough to do a whole festival by myself.
