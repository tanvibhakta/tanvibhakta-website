## Work

Video generation is expensive! What is the stack people typically work with, how do they prompt their models, how do they store and access memories for those models, and how do they not burn hundreds of dollars a day in the process?

We’re also actively hiring for a few engineering roles, and this means I’m interviewing people for the first time. How does one develop taste and judgement while interviewing? Apart from all the stuff I have to do for my software engineering job this week, I will

- read up on the ask a manager tips for interviewers
- figure out how to codify “taste” in people at the org by talking to the founders
- create a “bank” of questions to ask people (and understand the reasons for asking them)

Things I need to read up on:

1. How SSO works under the hood

## Health

The flare is still around, but not terrible this week. I made a mistake - I slept for less than 5 hours on both Wednesday night and Thursday night, and come Friday afternoon I had a splitting headache that no amount of ORS/bananas/warmth could solve. Some diclofenac finally helped, and a friend helped relax my muscles enough that I was able to power through the pain and take a nap.

I was woken from the nap by reports that Jamun had puked and was terribly low energy. One quick vet visit later, he has had an antacid injection and is on a probiotic schedule and a special diet. Monitoring remains.

I was reflecting with a friend that while my health has been pretty shit for the last year or so, and will continue to be shit for the foreseeable future, it isn’t actually volatile. I’ve gotten to a place where I know and am familiar with the rhythms of my body. I’m not healthy but my health is _stable_. That is very important and comforting to me.

## Life

I cooked a lot this week. It helped that I was working from home, and that I wasn’t very tired from my work.

On Thursday night, I had a small sleepover because on Friday morning a bunch of us watched [The Game Awards Show](https://thegameawards.com/)! I am in a long term, monogamous relationship with [Hades 2](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades-ii/), but it was fun to watch and learn about all the different kinds of experiences out there from my friends. I did watch [Ankur](https://ankursethi.com/) play the opening sequence of [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://www.expedition33.com/) last week, and it gave me chills, so it makes sense that [most nominated game ever](https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-collects-12-the-game-awards-nominations-the-most-in-the-awards-history) (in 12 categories!) swept at least 7 of them, including the coveted Game of The Year.

The Game Awards are the pet project of [Geoff Keighley](https://www.geoffkeighley.com/), who just had some money and decided to make this happen. We need more rich people to effect more societal change (like if Elon Musk [actually followed through](https://fortune.com/2022/12/12/elon-musk-gave-5-7-billion-to-charity-last-year-where-it-went-was-a-mystery-until-now/) on his [promise to donate 6B](https://www.snopes.com/news/2022/04/26/elon-musk-hunger/) to end world hunger). The Game Awards has done a lot in the last few years to legitimise gaming as an art form. I, for one, am very grateful.

Last weekend at [Indie Web Club](http://blr.indiewebclub.blog/) we discussed footers, and designing our personal spaces. Design language can tell you a lot about how to read the intent and nature of the website. I’m pretty unhappy with the aesthetics of this website, but it’s hard to figure out what to change it to because I don’t have very string opinions on that front.

I have been chugging away at my home decor project for a while, and I struggle with figuring out an aesthetic for that too. My living room has copper, wood, and orange accents, but most of them came together by virtue of accident. I’m going to have to use some kind of bookmarking/pinning product where I curate pictures of what I like and don’t like - for websites and for homes. Pinterest would have theoretically solved this problem, but like everything else, its enshittification has been hard to see - even if only from afar.

Over the weekend, some old friends from a hyper specific lifestyle group I joined in 2019 met up at a farmhouse two hours outside Bangalore. On the drive there, I reconnected with [Sreechand](https://www.sreechand.pm/), a friend from before the pandemic. Only over the course of that conversation, and that evening, did I realise how influential his opinions have been over my own personal value system. We live very close by and have two overlapping friend groups so hopefully we can hang out more often.

## Media Diet

### Reading

I’ve been really enjoying [Chip War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60321447-chip-war?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=ZGjbNyyoUu&rank=1). It feels like a detailed account of the first 4 pages of the first chapter of every computer science textbook I’ve had.

For the first time in a while, I don’t have a book of fiction that is going on in parallel - not even fan fiction! I just haven’t had the time. Maybe I need to get back into Romantasy.

### Listening

I really liked the new Jessie J album! The first half is stronger than the second. Other artists whose albums I enjoyed this week: Olivia Dean, Audrey Hobert, Jane.

I’ve been casually browsing r/popheads for the better part of a decade, but I think it’s time (especially since I almost never reddit anymore) that I include the weekly FRESH newsletters into my workflow.
