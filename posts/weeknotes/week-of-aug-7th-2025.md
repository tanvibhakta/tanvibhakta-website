## Work 

When it rains, it pours. There has been a lot of momentum on all kinds of interesting things I would like to do. Mostly with collaborators, but also some momentum on things I want to do by myself. I have been waking up energised *every single day* this week because I know exactly what I’m going to make happen in the world. What a beautiful feeling.

[Rosh](https://in.linkedin.com/in/roshni-ranganathan) referenced [Maria Popova](https://www.themarginalian.org/) in the context of her love for football yesterday: “If you want to fall in love with something you don’t, fall in love with people who do”[^1]. I can attest to this. I have always gravitated towards [doing things in communities](https://ankursethi.com/blog/i-learn-best-when-im-part-of-a-community/), and over the last year the community I have loved that has gotten me excited about programming again is the low-key tech community that [Nemo](https://captnemo.in/) runs via [RC-and-friends coworking](https://captnemo.in/cowork/) + the incessant curiosity that [Ankur](ankursethi.com/) and [Sohom](https://signalshore.net/) have brought into my life.

I published a note about [issues I had using cursor](/blog/cursor-ux-issues).

I have made significant progress on my own website, so that I can move away from this wonderful platform. No shade, you have been the best - but I intend to get a little more prolific than a single static page will allow me. 

## Life 

This weekend was spent recovering after a really hectic WedThuFri of work. I went to a new bar with some new friends after Writer’s club and ate a bunch of overpriced small plates. 

On Sunday morning I went to a [two-hour Film Festival](https://bangaloreinternationalcentre.org/event/imf-mountain-film-festival-india-tour-2025/) hosted by the Indian Mountaineering Foundation. It was Big Outdoors propaganda, and great fun! I dislike the outdoors - it’s nice when it is outside and I am inside - but I feel like a lot of that has to do with some terrible experiences I had when I was younger, plus my body being how it is. When I travel, I typically seek out cities, or urban centres of some kind. I love figuring out how people live their every day life in this completely alien environment. I love trying to suss out the fashion trends and micro-cultures that form in different localities and amongst different enthusiasts. People are so much more fascinating than trees. 

## Health

I think the flare is finally fading. I’ve spent most of last week in only the mildest of pain, and that also only when I’ve spent the whole day at my desktop. I still haven’t moved significantly - I am very afraid.

I am writing this early in the morning because my throat woke mw up with its itching. If I fall sick right now, when I have so much creation momentum going on, I will be very mad.

## Media Diet

### Reading

I started reading Jill Heinerth’s [Into the Planet: My Life as a Cave Diver](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43131602-into-the-planet). It is a memoir, and written to be very accessible. I first heard of the book when I [read an excerpt](https://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2019/09/20/jill-heinerth-cave-diving-antarctica) that described a very specific situation. Jill was the first person to dive into an iceberg. 

### Listening 

Renee Rap’s new album is really nice, and pop, and fun! There are a few skips, but it has emotional range. I’m definitely screaming along to Mad. 3/5, and this will stay on my rotation for a few weeks.

### Around the web

1. The [Wikipedia page for My Immortal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Immortal_(fan_fiction)) - arguably the greatest fanfiction ever written (/s)
2. [Scott Jenson explaining the reason for hype](https://jenson.org/hype/)’s existence.
3. [Herman](https://herman.bearblog.dev/)’s blog post on [how he manages his email](https://herman.bearblog.dev/digital-hygiene-emails/). I took a very similar approach to my email a few months ago, and it’s been radical. I use my email a lot more for professional and personal communication now.
