## Work

This week has been lots more selling. I don’t know how I got here but I am enjoying my confidence in my ability to create so much. The work page is up, and also some more nice styles etc. I’ve been doing a fair bit of cold outreach, which is quite different from everything I’ve done so far. I’m also dabbling in more UI frameworks than I did before - vue, flutter. It has been... interesting.

## Life

I spent a day at home and met a relative who lives far away and was here for a day. I allowed my parents to surprise me regarding a bent fender - they were not outraged. I somehow continue to have the car. It’s an exciting time in our relationship - baby’s first parking ticket happened. I worked from several different cafes and work spaces. I love friends and impromptu sleepovers.

## Health

This week has been very tiring. The migraine went away but it morphed into a really bad flare that raised its heads after almost 4 months of hibernation. It was bad. Tennis balls and cold packs have been delivered to the houses of various friends so things are slightly easier for me. I really need to write that “care for Tanvi” doc.

I also did not do any calisthenics this week. Partly it was the flare and fear of pushing my body, partly the sadness of knowing my fav trainer won’t be there; but it was also fear. I’ve been operating under a lot of fear this week and this has spilled into cali as well.

## Media Diet

### Reading

I listened to the BBC Adaptation of [Carmilla](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48037.Carmilla), where all the creepy scary groans sounded like extremely _fun_ moans. Intentional?

[Bird by Bird](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12543.Bird_by_Bird) continues to be so funny. I wish I had the copy I had annotated when I read it a few years ago. But I am annotating again, in my notes.

### Watching

I watched [Polite Society](https://letterboxd.com/film/polite-society/) - directed by the same person who wrote [We Are Lady Parts](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10846104/), a show that I _loved_. There is some overlap in cast. It was an incredibly fun take on the tired tropes of arranged marriage diaspora horrors. I am learning I am a big fan of well done action.

I also started watching [The Bucaneers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21108774/). It is.... literal fan fiction but with stunning visuals (because apple tv). The plot direction is predictable, the tropes are familiar, and yet. The characters are so intriguing and the pacing makes me want to melt into my seat!! If you enjoy the [`Fluff`](https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Fluff/works), and [`Hurt/Comfort`](https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Hurt*s*Comfort/works) tags on AO3 I would highly recommend this show.

### Listening

Kayan’s new EP! Has been gorgeous. Her classic RnB sound with more Raveena, more Chill. I really like.

### Around the web

1. [Winnie Lim’s writing on her internal work](https://rss.captnemo.in/history/entry/41525) is the kind of articulation I aspire to.
2. Sagnik’s cool [lightbulb <> Calender integration](https://swagnikd.com/posts/the-hobby-project-that-drained-my-wallet-and-taught-me-things/).
3. This excellent bit of [satire from McSweeney’s about new parenthood](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/congrats-dipshit-youre-a-dad-now) that we attempted to use as inspiration this writer’s club.
