My task management system broke down completely this week. I had a few bad days and then all the tasks piled up so naturally I did a bunch of sudoku and household chores before working up the courage to fix it. I have some hypotheses for how to build slack into the system but I won’t know for sure until I finish reading the damn book (Getting Things Done).

## Life

I have spent lots of low-level time with friends this week. Shruti spent a few days living with me, and then I hosted a session of Nonsense Movie Club, and this week Dee and Saket of [paus](https://paus.in/) are spending a few days with me. I somehow have a lot less energy this week and there’s so many things happening and I’m so glad for my friends but also tired.

## Health

No headaches :)

Calisthenics was really good! I’m much fitter than I expected to be. I even ran after on Sunday after class on Saturday. I’m hoping to continue to run every Sunday for the next ten weeks, after which I will gift myself new (expensive) running shoes.

Historically I have crashed every single time after a good workout. I haven’t crashed as hard but after the endorphins wore off on my second class on Tuesday I was definitely so much more tired than I should be, and that has just carried over into my week. How can I \

- increase the length of the post-workout endorphins?
- decrease the intensity of the post-endorphin crash?
  Assuming all primary factors (sleep, hydration, nutrition) are taken care of.

## Media Diet

### Reading

I finished the murderbot series and then this excellent dreamy novella - [The Empress of Salt and Fortune](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51190882-the-empress-of-salt-and-fortune) by Nghi Vo. It’s a dreamy tale of politics and intrigue - twice removed - in an East Asian setting. J’adore.

### Watching

I finally watched Legally Blonde. Is this what camp is about?

### Listening

I have been _obsessed_ with Faris Shafi’s [Introduction](https://open.spotify.com/track/62NkzAFZKNOe6arO1lSFm0?si=b253d19476a94b10) - a trilingual nonsense poser song with such great enunciation on a bangin beat. I cannot remember the last time I played a song on repeat - and yes, my friends are tired of me.
