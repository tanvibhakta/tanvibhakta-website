## Work

This week I’ve spent most of my time at work architecting things I don’t understand. The work I’ve been doing has been either

1. Think very hard about how to best do X
2. Spend very little effort babysitting an agent implementing X

I have a very strange relationship with the code I’m “writing” now. I [wrote a little about it](http://tanvibhakta.in/blog/llms-create-bad-code) earlier in the week.

The folks I’m contracting with are getting an office! I’ll be in the CBD area of Bangalore very often for the next few weeks, please DM me if you want to catch up in the area :)

I’m strangely excited about the office space. I’ve been enjoying the perks of remote work for a good 5 years now (thanks pandemic!) but I recognise that there are some kinds of work, and some kinds of teams, that just need to meet regularly and in person for ideas to be brought to life. I think it also allows for passive learning a lot more, and I’m so ready for it.

## Life

It was my birthday yesterday, and it was an excellent ~~day~~ weekend. I (like most (depressed?) people?) have had a complicated relationship with my birthday, gift giving, obligations etc. Three years ago I met someone who insisted on not only giving gifts but also receiving them, and that forced me to confront those complicated feelings. Also shout out to adult friend groups for remembering birthdays but not going overboard.

This year, I did something radical (for me). I didn’t do a party. I wanted to spend time with my friends, but I didn’t want to plan, and follow up, and stress, and worry, and organise, and handle shit. So... I didn’t. Quite a few people asked me what I’m doing, and I told them I’d love to spend time with them but I wasn’t planning a party, they were welcome to my house but could they please bring their own dabba, figure out party planning etc?

No one figured out the party planning, but that’s because no one else is me, and that’s fine. Some people showed up, and it was excellent. Several people could not, and that was alright too! I felt very taken care of by people all around - and most importantly, I didn’t really base any of sense my of self worth on the events or outcome of this day. I also now know what it’s like to have 15 people in my house. Maybe next year I’ll throw a thirty person party :) but I know I’m not going to stress about it.

This weekend is also Maya Bazaar weekend! It’s a carnival filled with queer businesses, queer performances, and queer people strutting, trawling, or fading into the background. I did so much shopping! Some highlights - a handloom sari in a beautiful rare light purple, binders!!!!!!!!!!!!! from the very excellent [Black Eagle Binders](https://www.blackeaglebinders.com/), a gorgeous cotton-linen tank dress with deconstructed element accents, a few gorgeous vases. Some things I wish I could have bought except no budget - corsets from Ashutosh who makes them from waste scraps, candles from [Good Conscience Co](https://goahomestudio.com/?v=320f6443c56b). I feel very satisfied with my haul.

This has been a very queer week for me. Fighting some uhaul stereotypes, fighting some airhead stereotypes. Find myself being desired. It’s a heady feeling.

## Health

I’ve had a cough left over from last week’s fever that just won’t go away. Sipping hot water regularly is the only thing that seems to help, so I’ve been doing that. I also have a fatigue cycle that’s led to me having some very strange working hours and sleep cycles. I deeply dislike this. I’ve slept at 5am 4 nights this week! to wake up at 8/9am and go about the rest of my day. I’m hoping the office routine is a forcing function to fix that.

## Media Diet

### Reading

I’ve read all the dramione, so now I’ve graduated to anypairs with Theo, and Pansy/Neville. I think I will soon be doing anypairs with Pansy.

### Listening

[King Princess’s new album](https://open.spotify.com/album/4aAqSQJ69OruOHDlQ9B5ki?si=iH3zEiZ-QNKfY3EGLMii4Q) is pretty decent!

### Around the web

I paid very little attention to my feed this week :( more in the next one!
