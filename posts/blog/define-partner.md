title: "Define: partner"

I used to think that if someone was my partner (or I was someone's partner) there was an obligation. And that the difference between a friendship and a partnership, no matter how strong the friendship, is that with the partnership, I would be obligated to say yes. I would owe it to my partner to stretch myself to show up for them. And I think this definition worked for a little bit, but not for very long. It breaks down in all kinds of social constructs where your friends show up for you and your partners aren't in a place to do so.

In a world where sex is not exclusive to partnership, and the distinction between romantic love and platonic love are just getting more blurry, I have never been able to — and I continue to not be able to — explain the difference between my closest friends and those I would call my partner.

For a while I thought it was about role. My partner is someone I can refer to in society as a romantic partner, and since they fit the definition and they play all the parts of the role that society expects, they are my partner. It's a circular definition! I live with someone, and I have sex with them, and I claim to love them (in public), and I stretch myself for them, and I show up with them in social situations, and I introduce them to my family, and I lean against them when I'm tired, and I expect them to skip work to take care of me when I'm sick, and I do the same for them, and I let their fights affect me, and I let my fights affect them. Then we're partners, right?

But I do most of these things with my friends anyway.

A friend quoted an Urdu poem that I don’t remember the exact words to, but it went something like this:

> Burn all the letters I’ve written to you, read and unread  
> For they contain the evidence of my love  
> You can extinguish that flame of letters with some water  
> But how can you extinguish the one in my heart?

And my answer immediately was _indifference_.

The opposite of love is not hate, it is indifference. I didn't break up with my most recent partner because I hated him. I broke up with him because I felt like I stopped mattering to him.

A partner, then, is someone that you **cannot** be indifferent to, someone who sticks around, whose every action, opinion, and thought changes the way you exist. It affects your comport, and any decision you can make. That's a big responsibility. This definition feels lofty, but it makes sense as a descriptor to the relationships I’ve seen around me. It is something I can align with in my existing relationships. So I think for now, that's the definition I will go with.

Obviously there are a lot of fallacies here. There's lots of people who I cannot be indifferent to. My boss, for example, or the Prime Minister. But maybe your partner is someone who you don't _let yourself_ be indifferent to, who you commit to hearing and supporting, or who you _commit_ to letting influence you. I think that's my definition for now.
