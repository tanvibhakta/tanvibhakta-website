I used cursor for a month for code work, using the claude.com interface only for one-off conversations or larger planning work. 

I have several nits to pick with the cursor team.

1. I’d like for the button to “show background AI agents” to pop up within the chat instead of being a separate button at the top. When I’m working with a wide screen I’d like to take advantage of the extra real estate.
2. This is especially true when the background AI agent is setting up a package or preparing an environment using the terminal. I hunted quite a bit and couldn’t find the terminal the background agent had opened and left something running that I wanted to kill. I finally had to restart the editor to do the job - not a good look!
3. They have inline code recommendations. The recommendations are almost never what I want to actually do with the code, and they disable the existing codesense autocomplete. AND they use up tokens? Dislike. 
4. Cursor is forked from VS Code, but they offer the ability to use JetBrains keybindings. Unfortunately the implementation of this is very janky - cmd + click, for example, adds a new cursor instead of jumping to the symbol.
5. Their implementation for shortcuts for their native features also seems to be quite buggy. The icon alt text keeps changing its mind on what the shortcut to open the AI pane is. It alternates between offering me two options (shift + esc and opt + cmd + B), neither of which work. 
6. The shortcuts for “review next file” don’t work, and the one for “Accept this chunk” works so poorly.

I hated every minute I used this product - but I used it anyway because I felt like I needed to give it enough time to see if the paradigm made sense to me. I tried out Zed and couldn’t figure out the UI at all[^1], and the add ons for jetbrains and vs code felt too hamstrung. Maybe I should have given Windsurf another shot? I last checked it out six to eight months ago. But my favourite editor will always be JetBrains (you cannot erase seven years of muscle memory), and therefore I have now jumped onto the Claude Code bandwagon.

[^1]: why am I automatically added to a voice chat with everyone else who is using Zed??? WHAT. Also how do you open the AI tab. I simply could not find the button, and I clicked every single one there was.
