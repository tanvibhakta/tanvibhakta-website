I’ll be attempting to follow along with [GloPoWriMo](https://www.napowrimo.net/) this year with a subset of my writing group. As [Shruti](https://www.shrutisunderraman.com/) astutely observed, I’ve made some of my best art when I wasn’t afraid to embrace (or wasn’t aware of) my cringe. Writing poetry is Cringe with a capital C, especially when forced and for no discernible purpose, so I’m excited to see what comes up!

If you’ve subscribed to this RSS feed for my weeknotes, my deepest apologies. Mataroa doesn’t seem to have a way to create a separate feed for different kinds of posts. Maybe I’ll finally migrate off this platform before the end of this month and everybody can subscribe to specific feeds on my website? Maybe I’ll loose all my friends to secondhand embarrassment.

I ran an anonymous poetry blog years ago, and I was proud of my work then but it was all born of angst and other emotions felt strongly. It’s been three days now and I’ve surprised myself with how much I have to say and the things I am saying it about. The idea of making this poetry public is a little scary because the things I’m writing about also bare parts of me I don’t really want to talk about or answer questions about too hard. Maybe with the website some poems will go away into the archive. Y’all are getting early access baby.
