title: "Stop snorting narrative"

I’ve been addicted to keeping my brain occupied for as long as I can remember. From grades 2 to 5 I would come home and immediately call my friends[^1], just to not _feel alone_, and I’d chatter with them for hours on end. By Grade 6, I knew my way around the pirate sites well enough that I could download all the books my heart desired. I used these books as a way to escape the dreary reality of childhood, a habit that served me well in my hostel years (no internet, but I _lived_ next to the library? Yes please!).

When I went to college, I had the internet again. It was scary how easy it was to substitute reading for social media - especially something like Reddit, which is mostly text based and allows for rabbit holes that felt exactly like reading a less rigorous [Mary Roach book](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/7956.Mary_Roach). I stopped reading long form almost entirely in those 4 years (except for around the exams, where I would restrict my internet usage and immediately fall into a Very Large Novel series. Thanks, [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/)!).

Like most of us, I’ve been struggling with some form of dependence on social media for the better part of a decade. But when I make the effort to remove myself from them, my life doesn’t get better. It isn’t the social media that is the problem, _it is my desire to consume narrative_. Stories are fundamental to who we are as humans[^2], and I am old enough that I know how to substitute for the internet. The exercise, then, is not to merely stop doing the thing that is hurting me. It is to answer a few fundamental questions for myself:

- What does rest look like for me, to actually feel restored?
- What activity do I fill my time with, to actually allow for thought?

[^1]: In Dubai, where I grew up, landline calls within the emirate were free; but the internet depended on the landline being available, and a second call wouldn't go through if the line was already occupied. This was very frustrating for my mum who couldn’t tell me anything about the house because I was too busy making up song lyrics with Shravani.
