I read this book as part of [Queer Read Bangalore](https://coolingpearls.wordpress.com/category/book-club-queer-reads-bangalore/)’s read along for July.
I will preface by saying that I consume very little horror in any media.

Overall 3/5 stars. Lots of stories in this anthology didn’t feel like horror, or didn’t feel like complete stories; but I appreciate this book for existing and these stories for introducing me to fun and new ideas!

**We frolic within the leviathan’s heart: 3/5**
I enjoyed the sense of longing, and the broadwalk scenes were vivid and made for a good reading experience. I wish the story had explored the actual leviathan experience more. This wish for something _just a little more_ set the tone for the rest of the stories.

**The Neon Holocaust: 1/5**
This immediately reminded me of [Carmen Maria Machado’s In the Dream House](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43317482-in-the-dream-house). Since [I really disliked that book](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7433599438), it’s no surprise that I disliked this story too.

**Morta: 3/5**
This story was about baby gay yearning. Been there, done that. The horror here was about the fear of hurting someone you love. Mild sff angle, reminded me of [Ryka Aoki’s Light of Uncommon Stars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56179360-light-from-uncommon-stars).

**Eclipse, or the courtship of the sun and the moon: 2/5**
I really liked this story!! Beautiful setting, imagery, the writing was so compelling and drew me in... and then the ending completely ruined it. If it was supposed to be a metaphor, I wish the writer had engaged with it or explored the consequences, even continuing the metaphor. As it stands, the ending feels like a copout, or a hack to meet a deadline.

**Stage five clinger: 4/5**
This story explores the feelings of baby girl gay, and how sometimes queer elders (as in not just age) can be exploitative? There is a scene of exquisite imagery near the end. Gorgeous. Knocking one star off because it was more body horror than horror.

**The love that whirls: 2/5**
Another story that missed the mark. There was a lot of prose and a lot of emotion, but I’m truly not sure what the story was meant to _say_.

**Crumbs: 5/5**
This story was the highlight of the collection for me. Truly atrocious, the writer achieved this effect through a masterful layering of at least 5 different types of horror. Every paragraph, every beat designed to evoke some fresh disgust in the reader. I am glad I read this collection for this story alone.

**Three for a funeral: 3/5**
The placement of this light, familiar YA story after the series of intense ones before it was a good call.

**The last disgrace: 4/5**
Every good werewolf story has to be followed by a good vampire story. This one was long, but vivid and beautiful. I think the ending of this one was also a little hamstrung, but the writer played out most of the beats they started with so I feel okay about it.

**The city behind the city: 3/5**
Another long one. I loved the surreal aspects to the story, but the MC himself seemed a little unrelatable.

**Therianthrope: 4/5**
Another lovely short that made me feel things. This one spoke in particular to the apprehensions bi/pan women have about approaching other women, a fear I identify with quite heavily.

**Macrame Flames: 3/5**
I’m not sure if it’s the prose, the setting, or the Satan, but this one felt quite reminiscent of [Good Omens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12067.Good_Omens). Once again, it’s the last paragraph that I’m knocking a second star off for. I understand the hesitation to bury our gays - but sometimes, the dead should stay dead.

I didn’t read **Heliogabalus Fabulous** because I was out of time and it felt more dreamy prose.

Throughout this collection, we see a few themes emerge: The horrific experience of being queer begins with abandonment. Every single one of the events in these stories would have gone differently if the protagonists had community - a parent wanting to know when they’ll be home, a friend to look out for them, a society that notices their absence.

I wouldn’t recommend this book to a horror fan, but I would recommend this book to someone who was looking to explore the inherent horror of being queer.
