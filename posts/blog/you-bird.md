You, bird.

_You_, bird.

You, bird!!!

Initially, this prompt confused me a little bit. I was even a little mad - these prompts are supposed to make you think, and be fit for a blog! But that’s not really true. Blogs don’t have to be deep. They don’t _have_ to be nuanced explorations of ideas.

The big thing that brings people back to social media is the culture. It’s the memes, and that feeling of being part of an in-group. I’ve been writing on my website for close to a year now, and I reliably miss shitpost culture. I want to make jokes that only five people will understand but those five people will find it hilarious, and I want to do this _outside_ the groupchat. If I want to reduce people’s reliance on social media, then I need to support blogging culture becoming more accessible. And yes, more whimsical. More fun.

I’ll confess - while at IndieWebClub we’ve been following along with the indie web carnival, I haven’t read the curation items yet. But this month I’m looking forward to it!
