There exists a web to consume outside of the Big Four of social media. Here is my process of figuring out how to consume it.

## RSS Readers

The PWA for miniflux is not very well designed and a little slow. I want to use an app that makes me feel good. REALLY dislike the idea of paying a monthly subscription for a reading app but it might be my only option. I'm trying [Reader from Readwise](https://read.readwise.io/) for a month, after which I'll try inoreader for another, and then pick between the two.

Exporting your feeds from miniflux will preserve feed categories, yay! It will not preserve read/unread states for articles, boo.

Focus Reader's UI feel glitchy + It kept unsyncing articles I had already read. I suspect there was an issue with how it was talking to miniflux. I didn't spend too much time debugging it; just decided to use the PWA for miniflux on mobile instead.

After trying a bunch of different feed readers I've settled on Focus Reader for android. Not ideal but I suppose it will get the job done.

Using a friend's miniflux instance, seems reasonable. Moved most newsletters from email to rss via [kill-the-newsletter](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/). Maybe now I will actually read them.

## Books

I just exported all of my data from Goodreads to Storygraph. Here's my [profile](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/tanvibhakta), send me a friendo!

The importer ported over all my shelves well, and all my reviews etc. But I mostly use goodreads as one of my few remaining forms of social media. I see what friends (especially long distance friends) are reading, text them about it, and am able to exchange conversations around ideas instead of events or people. Since there isn't exactly a "friend importer" on storygraph, I'm going to have to slowly look people up and nudge them over.
