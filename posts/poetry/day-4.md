My ajjol didn't live with paintings  
They lived with memories  
portraits  
of their parents  
commissioned at great personal cost  
hung up on the living room wall  
Garlanded

My ajja and ammama lived  
cheerful hard lives  
in a house with 40 people  
8 portraits garlanded and memoried  
on walls of lime green and on top of  
floors of red oxide and in the  
darkest corner, graced with wood from the  
tall jackfruit, teak, and mango  
was a treasury and a shrine  
filled with jewelry, hope, idols, and the  
bright blue, pink, and gold foil pictures of  
87 deities

Today, only 5 people live there  
but the gods and the spiders  
keep me company
