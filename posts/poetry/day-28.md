At large public events I always have noise dampeners in.

What is it about us that we need an excess to feel alive?  
Why does celebration have to  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overwhelm the senses  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drown out any thought  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be successful?

I want the quiet  
I want to feel my body  
I want to dance - not to be carried away by the music, but to float on it

yell at the people around me  
sweat on them  
clutch at clammy hands  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but still know that I am okay  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am here  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am here
