In the muddy waters of my childhood  
a river used to flow here.  
_gulu gulu, gulu gulu_  
joyous intertwining best friends meet upstream  
and tumble by in the backyard of my mother's childhood.  
Sprouts of jackfruit planted when she was a pre-pubescent teen  
feed me and 80 more on hot summer days  
green bean horse bean mushrooms moss green  
mangoes in tadka on our fresh banana plates.

The waters rise and the power cuts are longer  
A cobra slides over her feet  
the light of our portable inverters  
keep our secret card games company.

in their excitement, Tunga and Bhadra poured in uninvited  
ruining  
sacks of coffee beans piled to the ceiling  
The houses of innumerable bugs in the rooms with the machines  
Leading them to rust

today the jackfruit trees are just stumps  
felled by bitter sibling wars  
the river has before it a road  
uncaring drivers punctuate dry summers

Why does land being divvied sound like heartbreak?
