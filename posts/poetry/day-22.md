Nouv varsha Tanvi sakaali pode uTun yoga kartashile, tigel vastar iron kartashile, ani vattishele bhi, schoola vach kint pude!

Aiche Tanvi? Madhyan uTuna, nhavchak char paTi yochan karta.

Ushaar nashilten aashi jata. Konaki kasane karcha jaina.  
Udgaas davarnge charduanu, ushaar naashil tena, tugel aang bhi oorna, tugal man bhi urna.

Kasan urta?

Tigel yoga tik shikayle - tik kasht ashil kaam karcha jata.  
Tigel vastar tik shikayle - tigel anga khushi tik davarta.  
Tigel pustak shikayle - tigel man gelar bhi, dusral thodeee mangungetlar, kayiin chuka na tantu.

Tugel aiche jeev tuk mukar kasan shikayta?  
Hain yochan karna, bare karn need kadati.

9-year old Tanvi would get up early in the morning and do yoga, iron her clothes, and even study a little bit before heading to school!

Today’s Tanvi? Gets up at noon and wavers 4 times on taking a shower.

This is what happens when one is sick. There’s no way to hedge against this inevitability.  
Remember children, when you are sick, your body will disintigrate, and your mind will be consumed.

What’s left?

Her yoga taught her - she can do work, even if it is very hard.  
Her clothes taught her - her joy in her body will keep her.  
Her books taught her - even if her mind is depleted, no mistake is made in asking to borrow some from other people.

What will your life today teach you tomorrow? Think about this, and have a good sleep.
