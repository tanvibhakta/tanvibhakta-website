Talk to me, eternal love  
We grow and we change  
We say the same words but we mean different things  
Or they mean different things when we hear it

Talk to me of passion  
You watched me lose it  
Ask me how the search is going?  
Invite me into yours so I may see

Talk not to me of devotion  
I am all too familiar with it  
Cuckoos lay their eggs in the nests of crows.  
Where does the chick belong?

Attachment. We've talked about it.  
Old wounds, strangely healed.  
A future that should have been two years past  
haunts me with the rest of our unfinished sentences

Just talk to me.  
We'll Ina Mina Dika our way through the rest.
