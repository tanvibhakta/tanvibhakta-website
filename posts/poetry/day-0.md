He is small and cute and  
won't eat unless he has company

He is tiny and long and  
upset when I sleep away from him

He is loud and incessant  
especially when he hasn't got his twenty minutes of extra special focused attention today

He desperately wants to be in my lap  
but won't come unless I pull him in and plop him there


His big yellow eyes close softly  
Kissing my cheeks so gently  
Is this a portrait of him? Or is he a portrait of me?
